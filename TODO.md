# TODO

- Fix markdown configuration. Current one doesn't seem to be able to write to files
- Folding require you to create fold with f{zf% , feel like LSP should be doing this instead
- fzf includes folders like node_modules. Need to blacklist these folders from all search results. Considering including all files in .gitignore
- Using :bd closes the current buffer and the current pane. :bd should only close the current pane
- Consider finish setup of tmux-nvim shared buffers
- :e ./foo should refer to relative path from current buffer. Not the project directory. foo should refer to project directory
